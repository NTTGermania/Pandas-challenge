    "Based on the dataframes I've created, there are a few data that stood out for me.  First, the onverall passing rate for charter schools are much higher than the district schools (90% vs 54%).  Moreover, based on overall passing rate, the top 5 performing schools b are all charter schools while the bottom 5 performing schools are all district schools.  This is very surprising because we have almost the same number of district and charter schools (7 and 8 respectively).  I would be very interested to explore the reasons behind these data. A surprising discovery that I find is the inverse relationship between spending ranges (per student) and overall passing rate, meaning the more money spent per student the worse the overall passing rate is. I would have expected it to be opposite. In conclusion, I can firmly say that charter schools perform significantly better than district schools.  There are limitations to this dataset of course.  I could have been provided with the number of teachers per school, teacher salary, the income per family of the neighbourhood the schools are located in, etc... "
